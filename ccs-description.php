                <p>I was contracted to redesign a database for Coordinated Consulting Services, but upon hearing about their
                    issues with scalability, I suggested developing a web application to handle their needs of gathering and
                    reporting data. With scalability in mind, I built a robust web application that included a new database,
                    user account creation with secure user logins, and user input forms where data is uploaded and easily queried
                    for report building.</p>

                <p>I first approached Michael for a database redesign project. Upon hearing about my organization’s needs,
                    Michael was quickly able to provide technical solutions and suggested building a web application to
                    satisfy the scale-able needs of Coordinated Consulting Services. Michael’s programming talent as well
                    as his ability to create technical solutions provided Coordinated Consulting Services with an
                    effective and secure web application to be implemented on future projects. Michael stands by his
                    work and is dedicated to meeting the needs of his clients and colleagues. I would gladly recommend
                    Michael to those in need of web development, programming, or database services. </p>
